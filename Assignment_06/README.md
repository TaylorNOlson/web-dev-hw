1. Forms i have come across while browsing the web would be business online asking you to subscribe to their websites or even log in to your social media accounts. The purpose of the subscriptions are to get customers to enter their emails so the company can send them updates of any new sales going on and other things. The purpose of the log in pages are for people on social media such as Facebook to log in with their usernames and passwords to their accounts.

2. a.) An example of a text is a single line of text such as an email address or names.
   b.) An example of a selection is that the selected attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be selected when the page loads such as a option to select an answer on a questionaire which can allow one selection or multiple selections for answers. 
   c.) An example of a button input is a button to submit something such as a "submit" button at the end of a questionaire or a "subscribe" button after a customer enters their email to subscribe to a certain website/business.

3. My work cycle for Assignement_06 was that I made my folders and files for the assignment, then followed the directions from my professor on Moodle to complete my index.html and then finally answered the questions for the README.md on Moodle. After i completed those tasks i then saved my project on the GitHub app. (Committed to the master), and then transferred it to the origin and posted my two links to Moodle for grading.
