1. Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.The border separates the edge of one box from another.

3. My work cycle for this assignment was that i started with the index.html and created my divs and my artists information. I then went into style.css and did each different container and did all the widths, heights, padding, margins, etc. i then looked at the original artwork and went into a color coding sight to try and match each color to the artwork. Afterwords i fixed it up a bit with centering the artists info in the middle. Finally I completed my README.md and submitted it to GitHub and Moodle for grading!
