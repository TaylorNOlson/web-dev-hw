1.) A page can have six main documents <head> and <body> elements. These elements are different because the 'head' element displays your head of the webpage such as your information, like the author, description, style of website which does not appear of the web page to the public. However, There is the other headings which are within the body of the webpage that does appear to the public. The 'body' element displays everything within the body of the webpage such as paragraphs and other headings which does appear to the public on your webpage.

2.) The difference between structural and semantic markup is that structural is the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs and the semantic is what provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms.

3.) My work cycle for this assignment was that I created my assignment_05 along with all of the folders and files, then i followed the instructions given by my professor on Moodle while reading the intro to web-dev website on how to do everything along with the Jon Duckett book. Lastly, i then did my README assignment and  then submitted my homework!
