1. The universal selector applies to all elements in the document, it targets all elements on the page. The element selector matches elements names, it targets the heading elements. The class selector matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (or full stop) symbol. Lastly the ID selector matches an element whose
id attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol, it targets the element whose id attribute has a value of introduction.

2. The colors I chose were for the decade of 1960s style. I wanted to put the colors that were a trend in the 1960s and make my webpage pop with the colors and trends of what made up the 60's. I added the bold versatile colors that were a huge trend and I also added the huge exposition of Woodstock that brought hundreds of thousands of people together for peace, love, and music. I added yellow, pink, and purple. I also added for my background and my heading background gifs; images/original-graphic.gif, and images/graphic.gif.

3. My work cycle for this assignment was first starting with the index.html of what text and images I wanted to add, I then went to my style.css to created my colors, backgrounds, sizes of text, opacity, positions of my text and pictures. When I did add my images i first put them in the images folder and then into the index.html. Lastly I did my README.md and then saved it to my GitHub.
