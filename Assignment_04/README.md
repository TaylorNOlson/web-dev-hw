On the WayBack Machine, i checked out Facebook from February 14, 2006. The snapshot was of an old log in/sign up page for facebook users to access their Facebook accounts. You could enter your email and password and it showed a 'Welcome to Facebook' logo on the top. It was a very bare and simple page, there definitely wasn't much to it. The Facebook log in from 2006 to 2019 is that the webpage now has more creativity to it and a full paged website to log in or sign up rather than only a half page. the 2019 version looks a lot more up to date and nice, and it is not at all bare looking.
My experience with the GIT module seemed to be just fine. I felt like it was easy to navigate and understand. I really didn't find anything to difficult with it. I was able to enter the Assignment_04 successfully in it and know to always 'commit to master' after making changes. It was easy to use once i learned how to navigate it.
