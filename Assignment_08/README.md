1. I really enjoyed learning about HTML. I found that html plays an incredibly huge role in designing a webpage. It's basically a place where you go to add what you want to be view on your webpage. Everything i learn was new to me from adding your styles and fonts of the webpage, how you want your body to look, the divs, iframes, putting images and videos on your webpage, control the height and width, etc. It was all so cool to learn! Something very difficult to learn was the 3 media art logos in assignment 7 - Media. Which I still don't think i got it down, it was definitely one of the difficult things i found working with HTML.

2. I am very excited to be able to learn how to style and 'decorate' my webpages! I love getting creative and I can't wait to bring my homework to life more with this next section.

3. I created my folders and files in Atom as usual. I started with the index.html and did my Materials, Ingredients, Directions, and photo of the map first. I did create the lists for them however more towards the end of the assignment as we were told to have at least one list element. I then continued on to the about.html. i did the paragraphs, pictures, and then the map to the Butte Brewing Co. I then carried on to the contact.html and created the form element and then the table. Lastly I did the README.md and posted it to Grithub.
