1. A system font is designed to be installed on your computer and is ready for use in applications also installed on your system. A web font is a font especially designed for use in web pages, and is loaded with CSS @ font-face declaration. This makes the userâ€™s browser downloads web fonts and renders text correctly. A web-safe font is fonts that are one type of font on one computer but may not be the exact same font on another. They can differ a bit depending on the devices. It is based largely on its operating system.

2. It is important to have a fallback font because there are instances where primary fonts load slowly, and the next font in the stack takes its place while processing occurs.

3. My work cycle for Assignment_10 was my usual of adding the folders and files. I first wrote my index.html, then i styled my webpage in style.css including; colors, fonts, sizes, weights, etc. While i worked on the style.css I went to Google fonts and picked out my different fonts and added them to my fonts.css folder. I also found some different colors to work with as well and used some RGB colors. I then went back to my index.html and added my links and the different fonts for them. Lastly, I completed my README.md and loaded it to GitHub!
